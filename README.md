The code will look like the following:
```
ax.plot(lr_train_sizes, np.mean(lr_train_scores, axis=1), "o-", label="Training")
ax.plot(lr_train_sizes, np.mean(lr_test_scores, axis=1), "o-", label="Test")
ax.set_xlabel('Training set size', fontsize=18)
ax.set_ylabel('Average accuracy', fontsize=18)
ax.set_xticks(lr_train_sizes)
