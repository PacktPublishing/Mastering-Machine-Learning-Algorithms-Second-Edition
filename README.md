# Mastering Machine Learning Algorithms - 2nd Edition
This is the code repository for [Mastering Machine Learning Algorithms - 2nd Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/data/mastering-machine-learning-algorithms-second-edition), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the Book
A new second edition of the bestselling guide to exploring and mastering the most important algorithms for solving complex machine learning problems, updated to include Python 3.8 and TensorFlow 2.x as well as the latest in new algorithms and techniques.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
ax.plot(lr_train_sizes, np.mean(lr_train_scores, axis=1), "o-", label="Training")
ax.plot(lr_train_sizes, np.mean(lr_test_scores, axis=1), "o-", label="Test")
ax.set_xlabel('Training set size', fontsize=18)
ax.set_ylabel('Average accuracy', fontsize=18)
ax.set_xticks(lr_train_sizes)
ax.grid(True)

```
